//! Layer 2 — the conformance suite (docs/TESTING.md §3), wired against real
//! Redis containers.
//!
//! Passing these is the primary signal that this plugin implements the
//! `ClusterCacheBackend` and `DistributedLockBackend` contracts: the scenario
//! bodies are the shared, backend-agnostic ones every cluster backend runs, so a
//! divergence here is a divergence from the contract rather than from this
//! plugin's own expectations.
//!
//! # Four suites, and four is the complete set
//!
//! `cluster-conformance` exports six `run_*_conformance` entry points and only
//! four of them take a backend factory. `run_restart_conformance` and
//! `run_watch_lifecycle_conformance` exercise SDK-level combinator logic against
//! channels — there is no backend to hand them — so the four below are everything
//! a plugin can wire, not a subset someone stopped at.
//!
//! # `TimeControl::Real`, never `Virtual`
//!
//! Every suite passes [`TimeControl::Real`]. A paused or auto-advancing clock is
//! not merely unnecessary against a real backend, it is actively wrong: `fred`
//! runs its own per-command timeouts and its reconnect backoff on this same
//! runtime, and `tokio`'s paused clock auto-advances to the next pending timer
//! deadline whenever the runtime has nothing to poll — which, while a real socket
//! read is parked, is constantly. Those timers would fire spuriously and every
//! command would report `Provider { Timeout }` against a perfectly healthy
//! server. The Postgres plugin hit the same thing through `sqlx`'s acquire
//! timeout, which is what put `TimeControl` in the shared crate in the first
//! place.
//!
//! The cost is that the runners skip the two virtual-time fault simulations
//! (`SC-LEAD-006`, `SC-DISC-006`) themselves. Both force a *missed* renewal to
//! assert re-enrolment, which a healthy real backend never exhibits by waiting;
//! they map to fault injection, which this plugin has no harness for
//! (TESTING.md §8).
//!
//! # Which fixture each suite runs on, and why they differ
//!
//! | Suite | Fixture | Why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | cache | `start_redis` | Stock Redis is the deployment this plugin is for; its `EventuallyConsistent` declaration is honest and no cache scenario depends on linearizability |
//! | lock | `start_redis_lock_only` | The standalone `RedisLockPlugin` — the same path `ClusterLockProvider::build_lock` takes in production (DESIGN.md §3.5) |
//! | leader | **`start_redis_durable`** | `CasBasedLeaderElectionBackend::new` is the strict constructor and *refuses* an `EventuallyConsistent` cache, so on the default fixture this suite would fail to construct rather than fail a scenario |
//!
//! The leader row is the one wrinkle no other backend has, and it is deliberately
//! *not* worked around with the `allow_weak_consistency` opt-in. That flag
//! makes weak-cache leader election **expressible by an operator who opts in**,
//! not correct — and this suite asserts correctness properties like
//! single-leader-among-contenders. Pointing it at a weak cache via the flag would
//! produce a suite asserting guarantees the backend does not claim: a test that
//! fails for the right reason at the wrong layer. The flag's own path is
//! `RD-SPEC-004b`, and the negative half — that the strict constructor really does
//! refuse the ordinary container's cache — is `RD-SPEC-004`, which is the more
//! important of the two.
//!
//! # One container per suite, one backend per scenario
//!
//! Each suite starts a single container and builds a **fresh plugin instance per
//! scenario** over it, isolated into its own logical database *and* its own
//! `key_prefix` (`common::cluster_config_for_scenario`). A shared backend across
//! scenarios is not viable: the scenarios reuse key and lock names, and this
//! plugin's `stop()` deliberately *leaves* held leases to expire rather than
//! handing them back (`cpt-cf-clst-fr-shutdown-ttl-cleanup`), so a lease held past
//! one scenario's teardown would still be held when the next asked for the same
//! name.
//!
//! # Each suite is `Box::pin`ned
//!
//! A `run_*_conformance` future holds every scenario body in the suite, so it is
//! ~20 KB and trips clippy's `large_futures` (denied workspace-wide via
//! `pedantic`). Boxing is the right answer rather than an `allow`: these run once
//! per suite, so one heap allocation is free, and a 20 KB future living on the
//! stack of a test thread is worth avoiding on its own merits.
//!
//! Every `ScenarioBackend` is built with
//! [`ScenarioBackend::with_teardown`](cluster_conformance::ScenarioBackend::with_teardown)
//! and its teardown owns the handle and `stop()`s it. That is mandatory rather
//! than tidy: `RedisClusterHandle` and `RedisLockHandle` both **panic on drop**
//! without `stop()` in a debug build (ADR-006), which is what a test build is — so
//! a factory that dropped a handle would abort the process instead of failing a
//! test. `run_scenario` awaits the teardown even when a scenario assertion panics,
//! so this holds on the failure path too.
