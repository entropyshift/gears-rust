## Entries

### AP-D-1 The inbox is a facade and has no authorization resource

The units stay in the gear that writes them. The inbox reads and routes. It does not implement a database capability and it does not call `db_required`.

The gateway authenticates the caller. The inbox does not judge a grant. Each source door authorizes with its own resource. The problem type on an inbox refusal names the error envelope, not an authorization resource.

### AP-D-2 The merge, the cursor, the narrowing and book_id

The shared order is the facade's merge key: `submitted_at` as an instant, then the unit id in the same direction. That amends the per-gear order only by being the key the inbox merges on. Each gear's own door is unchanged.

Every source is asked on every page after its own key. The key becomes the last unit taken from that source, or stays. There is no exhausted state. The next cursor is present when any source had more or returned a unit that was not taken.

The cursor carries its order outside the narrowing hash. `$orderby` with a cursor is 400 `ORDER_WITH_CURSOR`. A changed narrowing is 400 `FILTER_MISMATCH`.

**Amended by AP-D-8 (2026-10-02).** `$orderby` is published with `.with_odata_orderby`, so the served contract carries `x-odata-orderby` for `submitted_at asc` and `submitted_at desc`. The door still accepts only that field.

A kind outside a gear's closed set is an empty page and zero counts, computed in the source. `book_id` on products is that same empty set. `book_id` on pricing remains the alias of `ref_id`: it keeps `prices` units of that book and no `plan_revision`, whose reference is the revision. A state or id the door would refuse is that refusal for the whole read.

A source added to the configuration later starts from an empty key. A removed source's key is ignored.

Run 2 amends this entry (pricing D-490, products P-D-250). Each real source builds the pager's own `CursorV1` from its key and reads through its gear's list read, so the keyset is the pager's column compare. A kind that no gear records, such as `bogus`, is therefore an empty page and zero counts from every source: the inbox answers 200 with no unit and every readable source named `ok`, never 400.

**Amended 2026-10-02.** A configured source name is non-blank and unique. A duplicate or a blank name fails the boot, so a merge cannot see one source twice and a card cannot treat one gear as two owners. A source counts body names only the closed kind set. A kind field that is absent is 0. A kind field outside the set does not decode, so a renamed kind fails the read instead of being counted as zero.

### AP-D-3 Grants and owner resolution

On the list and the counts, a source that answers 403 is omitted and named `forbidden`. When every source answers 403, the read is 403 and the body names no gear. A source that answers 503, or is not registered, is 503 `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` naming it. `total` counts the readable sources only.

**Amended by AP-D-5 (2026-10-02).** A down or unregistered source is named `unavailable` and omitted. The read fails with 503 only when every configured source is down.

On the card and the vote, every source is asked. One hit wins. Two hits are 500 naming both. Otherwise any 503 or missing source is 503 `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`. Otherwise any 403, with the rest missing, is 403 whose body names no gear. Otherwise the unit is 404.

### AP-D-4 Votes and idempotency

The inbox resolves the owner with the card's rule, then calls that source's single `vote` with the request body bytes and the `Idempotency-Key` as received. The source calls its own vote door, under that door's grant, with that door's own path as the idempotency endpoint. The facade and the direct door therefore share one idempotency row.

The door's answer is returned unchanged: status, headers and body. The success body is the door's receipt. A refusal keeps the door's body, including `generation` on `GENERATION_MISMATCH` and `UNIT_STALE`.

Run 2 amends this entry (pricing D-490, products P-D-250). Each source sends the vote to its gear's vote door through that gear's router, under the gear's enforcer and the platform's error layer, with the body bytes as `application/json`. A refusal therefore leaves the door with its `instance` naming the door's path. The inbox marks its answer as a passthrough (`ForeignPassthrough`), so the platform's error layer around the inbox does not rewrite a refusal the door already shaped. A refusal's `trace_id` is the one the door's layer derived: the source forwards no trace header. A facade vote and a direct vote with the same key and body replay once in both gears, and the same key with another body is the door's 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`, byte for byte.

Declared codes: 400 `GENERATION_REQUIRED`, `GENERATION_MISMATCH`, `UNIT_STALE`, `NOTE_REQUIRED`, `NOTE_TOO_LONG`, `BODY_UNEXPECTED`; 403 for the grant and `SOD_VIOLATION`; 404; 409 `DUPLICATE_VOTE`, `UNIT_ALREADY_DECIDED`, `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`; 503. These doors do not answer 412. `InboxUnit` has no version.

**Amended by AP-D-6 (2026-10-02).** The inbox no longer forwards a vote that arrived without `Idempotency-Key`.

### AP-D-5 A down source is omitted and the walk does not resume it

**Status:** DECIDED 2026-10-02.

The list and the counts answer the sources that answered. A source that answers 503, or is not registered, is named `unavailable` in `sources` and contributes nothing. `InboxSourceStatusDto` is `ok`, `forbidden` or `unavailable`. The counts carry `sources` with that status.

- When every configured source is unavailable, the read is 503 `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` naming them, as before.
- When every configured source is forbidden, the read is 403 and the body names no gear, as before.
- A mix of forbidden and unavailable, with no source that answered, is 200 with an empty page or zero counts and both statuses.
- The card and the vote are unchanged: one owner, and that owner's 503 stays 503.

The cursor records the sources that were unavailable when it was cut. A continuation does not ask those sources, and names them `unavailable`, even when they would answer. A source that goes down on a later page is recorded on that page's cursor and stays omitted after it. A client re-reads from the first page to include a source that was down. Newest-first holds because a source is never inserted into a walk that started without it.

The narrowing hash is the canonical JSON of `book_id`, `kind`, `ref_id` and `state`, so an absent value and an empty string do not share a hash. The cursor version is 2. A token cut before this deploy is 400 `INVALID_CURSOR`.

The sources of one list or one counts are asked concurrently. `sources` stays in configuration order.

**Source:** Owner, 2026-10-02 (ask 60, "все ок"). Amends AP-D-2 and AP-D-3.

### AP-D-6 The inbox requires the caller's Idempotency-Key

**Status:** DECIDED 2026-10-02.

Approve, reject and withdraw on the inbox require `Idempotency-Key`. The header is required in the served spec. A missing or empty key is 400 `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED` on the field `Idempotency-Key`. A value that is not text is 400 `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_INVALID` on that same field. The inbox forwards the key it received and never mints one. The products and pricing vote doors are unchanged: a direct call still follows that door's own rule.

A query the inbox cannot parse is 400 `INVALID_QUERY_PARAMS` on the field `query`, carrying the parser's text. It is not an `INVALID_FILTER`.

**Source:** Owner, 2026-10-02 (ask 61, "все ок"). Amends AP-D-4.

### AP-D-7 The inbox unit carries whether the caller may reject or withdraw it

**Status:** DECIDED 2026-10-02.

`InboxUnit` and `InboxUnitDto` carry `caller_can_reject` and `caller_can_withdraw` beside `caller_can_approve`. The owning gear judges them (products P-D-255, pricing D-497). The inbox copies the door's values and does not judge a grant of its own.

**Source:** Owner, 2026-10-02 (ask 63, "все ок").

### AP-D-8 The inbox publishes `$orderby` through the toolkit

**Status:** DECIDED 2026-10-02.

The list declares `$orderby` with `.with_odata_orderby::<InboxOrderField>()`. The served contract therefore carries `x-odata-orderby` for `submitted_at asc` and `submitted_at desc`. The door still accepts only `submitted_at`, ascending or descending, and refuses any other order with 400 `INVALID_ORDERBY_FIELD`. The query struct does not rename a field to `$orderby`.

**Source:** Phase 9 review fix (architecture lints DE0802 and DE0803). Amends AP-D-2.
